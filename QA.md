### 1. **How would you approach migrating a legacy .NET Framework monolithic application to .NET Core while minimizing risks and downtime?**

**Answer:** I would follow a phased approach:

1. **Assessment Phase**: Identify dependencies, third-party libraries, and features incompatible with .NET Core. Create a compatibility matrix for key components like database access, authentication, and custom libraries.
2. **Modularization**: Break the monolith into smaller components or services (if transitioning to microservices). Begin by isolating non-critical services, ensuring they work under .NET Core.
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Implement automated tests (unit and integration tests) to ensure no breaking changes. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines should run parallel tests for both .NET Framework and .NET Core during the transition.
4. **Side-by-side Deployment**: Consider using a hybrid approach, where both .NET Framework and Core run together until the complete migration is achieved, leveraging APIs or message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka to decouple parts of the system.
5. **Incremental Rollout**: Gradually roll out each migrated module to production to reduce risks and catch issues early.
